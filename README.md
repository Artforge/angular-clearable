# AngularJS Clearable Directive

An [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) directive for adding a clear button inside an input element.

## How to use angular-clearable

Just include `ng-clearable.js` after angularjs (jQuery is not required).
Then you will need to make sure you require `ngClearable` in your app module. That's it!

Using the `ng-clearable` directive is pretty simple:

```
<input type="text" ng-model="test" ng-clearable />
```
